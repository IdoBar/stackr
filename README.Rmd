# stackr: an R package for the analysis of GBS/RADseq data

This is the development page of the **stackr**, 
if you want to help, see [contributions section](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr#contributions)

Most genomic analysis look for patterns and trends with various statistics. 
Bias, noise and outliers can have bounded influence on estimators and interfere
with polymorphism discovery. Avoid bad data exploration and control the impact
of filters on your downstream genetic analysis. Use stackr to: import, explore,
manipulate, visualize, filter, impute and export your GBS/RADseq data.


## Installation
To try out the dev version of **stackr**, copy/paste the code below:

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # to install
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr")
library(stackr)
```

## Prerequisite - Suggestions - Troubleshooting
  * **Parallel computing**: Follow the steps in this [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_imputations_parallel.Rmd)  to install [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) and [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) packages (e.g. to do imputations in parallel).
  * **Installation problem:** see this
  [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_installation_problems.Rmd)
  * **Windows users**: Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
  * For a better experience in **stackr** and in R in general, I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 
  The R GUI is unstable with functions using parallel ([more info](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mclapply.html)). 

## Vignettes, R Notebooks and examples

**Vignettes (in development, check periodically for updates):**

* Vignettes with real data for example in the form of R Notebooks take too much
space to be included in package, without CRAN complaining.
Consequently, vignettes are gradually being excluded from the package and
distributed separately, follow the links below.
* [installation problems](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_installation_problems.Rmd)
* [parallel computing during imputations](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_imputations_parallel.Rmd) 
* [vcf2dadi](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_vcf2dadi.Rmd)
* [haplo2genind](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_haplo2genind.Rmd)

**R Notebooks:**

* Missing data visualization and analysis [(html vignette)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4zf032g6yjatj0a/vignette_missing_data_analysis.nb.html?dl=0) and [(Rmd)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fxw2h9w1l1j391/vignette_missing_data_analysis.Rmd?dl=0)

## New features
Change log, version, new features and bug history now lives in the [NEWS.md file](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/NEWS.md)

**v.0.5.8 2017-08-14**

* bug fix: removed the progress bar when using parallel computing. This is temporary, while waiting for a fix with `pbmcapply` package.


**v.0.5.7 2017-06-17**

* **stackr** works with `dplyr v.0.7.0`


**v.0.5.6 2017-06-08**

* `tidy_genomic_data`: bug fix that originated with the new version of PEGAS.
* `summary_haplotypes` : updated codes and output tables.
* `pi`: a new function to compute Nei's Pi nucleotide diversity from a wide range of 
input files. The haplotype version is found in `summary_haplotypes`.
* **2 new functions to work with vcf:** `merge_vcf` and `split_vcf`.
* `run_ustacks`: allows to run `Stacks` ustacks module inside R with the option
to run mismatch thresholds testing...

**v.0.5.5 2017-05-23**

* `tidy_genomic_data` : bug fix introduce with previous commit when fixing
`LOCUS` and `COL` with stacks version > 1.44.
Thanks to Eric Archer for highlighting the bug.

* `summary_haplotypes`: this function gets a new arguments, `keep.consensus`, to 
enable the calculation of **pi** to include or not the consensus markers presents
in stacks haplotype file (e.g. *batch_1.haplotypes.tsv*). This argument works to
circumvent the impact of using a whitelist of markers,
that potentially removed those markers in previous versions. Also changed in this 
function, the summary table include a **POLYMORPHISM** column that no longer
include the artifact marker counts (markers with more than 2 alleles).
This information is kept in a separate column (as before). 

**v.0.5.4 2017-04-06**

* `detect_duplicate_genomes` : huge speed bump for pairwise genome similarity method.
Instead of hours the range is more in minutes.

**v.0.5.3 2017-04-05**

* `stackr_imputations_module` : better integration of VCF with haplotypes so
that nucleotide information is kept during imputations.
* `filter_fis` : bug fix when no heterozygote were found. Thanks to Manuel Lamothe.

**v.0.5.2 2017-03-27**

* `stackr_imputations_module` : work on faster on-the-fly random forest and
extreme gradient tree boosting algorithm.

## stackr workflow 
Currently under construction. Come back soon!

**Step 1 Quality** Ask yourself these questions: 

* DNA quality, libraries quality, sequencing lanes quality ? 
* Please stop thinking in terms of quantity (e.g. millions of reads returned), and start thinking about actual quality of your new data.
* Use quality metrics inside available software (e.g. fastqc)

**Step 2 *de novo* assembly and genotyping** 

* This is conducted outside stackr
* Integrated software pipelines include: [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/), [pyRAD](http://dereneaton.com/software/), [dDocent](https://ddocent.wordpress.com), [AftrRAD](http://u.osu.edu/sovic.1/downloads/). If you want to develop your own pipeline, 
there are a multitude of approaches, good luck. 

**Step 3 Outliers**

* Remove replicates (I hope you have some).
* Remove *de novo* assembly artifact, by creating blacklist of genotypes or whitelist of markers:
    * individuals with more than 2 alleles (use `summary_haplotypes`)
    * outlier markers with extreme number of SNP/read or haplotype (use `filter_snp_number`)
* Remove potential duplicated samples that went off your radar, try `detect_duplicate_genomes`.
* Highlight outliers individual's heterozygosity that might represent mixed samples with `detect_mixed_individuals`.
* The metric you're using: a *de novo* artefact or a reliable signal of biological polymorphism?
* Should the statistic you are interested in be consistent throughout the read ?
* Will you consider haplotype or snp level statistics?
* The consistensies of SNPs statistics among haplotype can be throughly tested by using `snp.ld` argument in several stackr functions.
* Any other outliers with different individual's or markers metrics (reads/sample, etc) ?

**Step 4 Pattern of missingness**

* Use `missing_visualization` with/without your new blacklists (e.g. of genotypes, individuals) and with/without whitelist of markers to examine patterns of missingness in you dataset before more extensive filtering (there is a vignette for this step)
* The trick here is to use the `strata` argument to find patterns associated with different variables of your study (lanes, chips, sequencers, populations, sample sites, reads/samples, etc).
* Do you see a trend between your missing pattern and reads/samples ? Heterozygosity?
* Do you need more sequencing? Do you have to re-run some lanes? 

**Step 5-6 Coverage and Genotype Likelihood**

* Coverage is an individual metric. With most software you'll find allele and genotype coverage info.
* Genotype likelihood is usually a metric based on coverage of the different genotypes found in all of your data.
* Good allele coverage is required for reliable genotypes.
* Reliable genotypes is required for reliable downstream summary statistics.
* Explore filtering options in `filter_coverage` and `filter_genotype_likelihood`.

**Step 7 Prop. Genotyped**

* Do you have enough individuals in each sampling sites (`filter_individual`) 
and enough putative populations (`filter_population`) for each markers ?
* Use blacklist of individuals with different thresholds.
* Keep different whitelist of markers.
* Use `common.markers` argument inside most of stackr functions to test the impact of vetting loci based on shared markers.
* Use imputation methods provided by stackr (inside `tidy_genomic_data` or `genomic_converter`, as a separate module: `stackr_imputations_module`) to assess the impact of lowering or increasing threshold that impact missing data.

**Step 8 HET, Fis, HWE**

* Overall and/or per populations hwe, heterozygosity and Fis statistics can highlight: 
*de novo* assembly problems (oversplitting/undermerging), genotyping problems or
biological problems.
* These filters allows to test rapidly if departure from realistic expectations
are a problem for downstream analysis ?
* Choose your threshold wisely and test impact on pipeline.
* Use `filter_het`, `filter_fis`, `filter_hwe` and look again 
at the individual's heterozygosity (`detect_mixed_individuals`) for outliers.

**Step 9 MAF**

* Remove artifactual and uninformative markers.
* Use MAF arguments inside several of stackr functions to tailor MAF to your analysis tolerance to minor allelel frequencies.
* There is also a separate filter in stackr: `filter_maf`

**Step 10 Pattern of missingness, again**

* Use `missing_visualization` with your new blacklists (e.g. of genotypes, individuals) and with your whitelist of markers to examine patterns of missingness in your dataset after filtering (there is a vignette for this step)
* The trick here is to use the `strata` argument to find patterns associated with different variables of your study (lanes, chips, sequencers, populations, sample sites, reads/samples, etc).
* Do you see a trend between your missing pattern and reads/samples ? Heterozygosity?
