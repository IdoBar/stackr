# stackr: an R package for the analysis of GBS/RADseq data

This is the development page of the **stackr**, 
if you want to help, see [contributions section](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr#contributions)

## Use stackr to: import, explore, manipulate, visualize, filter, impute and export your GBS/RADseq data

* **Import/Export** various supported genomic file formats: 
    * *VCF*, *PLINK* , *genlight*, *genind*, *genepop*, *hierfstat*, *gtypes*, *betadiv*, *dadi*, *tidy*, *wide* and the haplotype file produced by [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/).
    * easy integration with other software or R packages like [adegenet](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet), [strataG](https://github.com/EricArcher/strataG), [hierfstat](https://github.com/jgx65/hierfstat), [pegas](https://github.com/emmanuelparadis/pegas), [poppr](https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr) and [assigner](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/assigner). 
    * conversion functions are integrated with important filters, blacklist and whitelist.

* **Explore** and **filter** important variables caracteristics and statistics. Most genomic analysis look for patterns and trends with various statistics. Bias, noise and outliers can have bounded influence on estimators and interfere with polymorphism discovery. Avoid bad data exploration and control the impact of filters on your downstream genetic analysis:
    * alleles, genotypes, markers, individuals and populations can be filtered and/or selected in several ways.
    * visualize patterns of missing data,
    * read depth (coverage) of alleles and genotypes, 
    * genotype likelihood,
    * genotyped individuals and populations,
    * minor allele frequency (local and global MAF),
    * observed heterozygosity (Het obs), inbreeding coefficient (Fis) and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium expectations (HWE)
    * find duplicate individuals
    * detect potentially mixed samples

* **Map-independent imputation** of missing genotypes 
using Random Forest or the most frequent genotype.

* **Visualization:** `ggplot2`-based plotting for publication-ready figures.

 
## Installation
To try out the dev version of **stackr**, copy/paste the code below:

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # to install
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr", build_vignettes = TRUE)  # to install WITH vignettes
library(stackr) # to load
```

## Prerequisite - Suggestions - Troubleshooting
  * **Parallel computing**: Follow the steps in this [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_imputations_parallel.Rmd) 
  to install an OpenMP enabled [randomForestSRC](http://www.ccs.miami.edu/~hishwaran/rfsrc.html)
 package to do imputations in parallel.
  * **Installation problem:** see this
  [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_installation_problems.Rmd)
  * **Windows users**:  1. Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). 2. To have *stackr* run in parallel, use [parallelsugar](https://github.com/nathanvan/parallelsugar).
  Easy to install and use ([instructions](https://github.com/nathanvan/parallelsugar#installation)).
  * For a better experience in **stackr** and in R in general, I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 
  The R GUI is unstable with functions using parallel ([more info](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mclapply.html)). 


Below, the combination of packages and how I install/load them :

```r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
library("pacman")
pacman::p_load(devtools, tidyverse, data.table, parallel, lazyeval, randomForestSRC)
pacman::p_load(devtools, tidyverse, data.table, parallel, lazyeval, randomForestSRC)
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("stackr")
```

## New features
Change log, version, new features and bug history now lives in the [NEWS.md file](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/NEWS.md)


**v.0.4.5**

* temporary fix to `tidy_genomic_data` to read unconventional Tassel VCF

* new function `ibdg_fh` computes the FH measure that was previously
computed in `summary_haplotypes`.
It now works with biallelic and multiallelic data.

  The FH measure is based on the excess in the observed number of homozygous
genotypes within an individual relative to the mean number of homozygous
genotypes expected under random mating (see function for details). The `IBDg` in
the name is because the measure is a proxy of the realized proportion of the genome
that is identical by descent by reference to the current population 
under hypothetical random mating.

* `missing_visualization` now computes the FH measure and look for correlation
with average missingness per individual.

**v.0.4.4**

* several updates to make functions faster.
* `stackr_imputations_module` no longer imputes globally after imputations
by populations. Instead, use `common.markers` or not to test impacts.
*  bug fix with `ref_alt_alleles` that was not working properly inside
the imputation module.
* `snp_ld` is not a separate module available for users. Check documentation.
* `missing_visualization` now show the proportion of variance with plot axis text.

**v.0.4.3**

* bug fix in `summary_haplotypes` stemming from a new `readr` version
* `artifacts` replace `paralogs` in `summary_haplotypes`

## stackr workflow 
Currently under construction. Come back soon!

**Step 1 Quality** Ask yourself these questions: 

* DNA quality, libraries quality, sequencing lanes quality ? 
* Please stop thinking in terms of quantity (e.g. millions of reads returned), and start thinking about actual quality of your new data.
* Use quality metrics inside available software (e.g. fastqc)

**Step 2 *de novo* assembly and genotyping** 

* This is conducted outside stackr
* Integrated software pipelines include: [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/), [pyRAD](http://dereneaton.com/software/), [dDocent](https://ddocent.wordpress.com), [AftrRAD](http://u.osu.edu/sovic.1/downloads/). If you want to develop your own pipeline, 
there are a multitude of approaches, good luck. 

**Step 3 Outliers**

* Remove replicates (I hope you have some).
* Remove *de novo* assembly artifact, by creating blacklist of genotypes or whitelist of markers:
    * individuals with more than 2 alleles (use `summary_haplotypes`)
    * outlier markers with extreme number of SNP/read or haplotype (use `filter_snp_number`)
* Remove potential duplicated samples that went off your radar, try `find_duplicate_genome`.
* Highlight outliers individual's heterozygosity that might represent mixed samples with `filter_individual_het`.
* The metric you're using: a *de novo* artefact or a reliable signal of biological polymorphism?
* Should the statistic you are interested in be consistent throughout the read ?
* Will you consider haplotype or snp level statistics?
* The consistensies of SNPs statistics among haplotype can be throughly tested by using `snp.ld` argument in several stackr functions.
* Any other outliers with different individual's or markers metrics (reads/sample, etc) ?

**Step 4 Pattern of missingness**

* Use `missing_visualization` with/without your new blacklists (e.g. of genotypes, individuals) and with/without whitelist of markers to examine patterns of missingness in you dataset before more extensive filtering (there is a vignette for this step)
* The trick here is to use the `strata` argument to find patterns associated with different variables of your study (lanes, chips, sequencers, populations, sample sites, reads/samples, etc).
* Do you see a trend between your missing pattern and reads/samples ? Heterozygosity?
* Do you need more sequencing? Do you have to re-run some lanes? 

**Step 5-6 Coverage and Genotype Likelihood**

* Coverage is an individual metric. With most software you'll find allele and genotype coverage info.
* Genotype likelihood is usually a metric based on coverage of the different genotypes found in all of your data.
* Good allele coverage is required for reliable genotypes.
* Reliable genotypes is required for reliable downstream summary statistics.
* Explore filtering options in `filter_coverage` and `filter_genotype_likelihood`.

**Step 7 Prop. Genotyped**

* Do you have enough individuals in each sampling sites (`filter_individual`) 
and enough putative populations (`filter_population`) for each markers ?
* Use blacklist of individuals with different thresholds.
* Keep different whitelist of markers.
* Use `common.markers` argument inside most of stackr functions to test the impact of vetting loci based on shared markers.
* Use imputation methods provided by stackr (inside `tidy_genomic_data` or `genomic_converter`, as a separate module: `stackr_imputations_module`) to assess the impact of lowering or increasing threshold that impact missing data.

**Step 8 HET, Fis, HWE**

* Overall and/or per populations hwe, heterozygosity and Fis statistics can highlight: 
*de novo* assembly problems (oversplitting/undermerging), genotyping problems or
biological problems.
* These filters allows to test rapidly if departure from realistic expectations
are a problem for downstream analysis ?
* Choose your threshold wisely and test impact on pipeline.
* Use `filter_het`, `filter_fis`, `filter_hwe` and look again 
at the individual's heterozygosity (`filter_individual_het`) for outliers.

**Step 9 MAF**

* Remove artifactual and uninformative markers.
* Use MAF arguments inside several of stackr functions to tailor MAF to your analysis tolerance to minor allelel frequencies.
* There is also a separate filter in stackr: `filter_maf`

**Step 10 Pattern of missingness, again**

* Use `missing_visualization` with your new blacklists (e.g. of genotypes, individuals) and with your whitelist of markers to examine patterns of missingness in your dataset after filtering (there is a vignette for this step)
* The trick here is to use the `strata` argument to find patterns associated with different variables of your study (lanes, chips, sequencers, populations, sample sites, reads/samples, etc).
* Do you see a trend between your missing pattern and reads/samples ? Heterozygosity?
