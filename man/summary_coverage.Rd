\usage{
summary_coverage(tidy.vcf, pop.levels, filename)
}

\item{tidy.vcf}{A tidy vcf object or file (using ".tsv"), 
created with tidy_genomic_data.}

\item{pop.levels}{Character string defining your ordered populations.}

\item{filename}{Name of the file saved to the working directory.}
}
\value{
A list with 2 tables: the long format of loci and populations
coverage statistics and the short format by populations.
The short-format is more user-friendly and
