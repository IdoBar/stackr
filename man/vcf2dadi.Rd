\title{Create a \code{dadi} SNP input file from a STACKS vcf file.}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The VCF file created by STACKS or imputed VCF file created
by \code{\link[stackr]{vcf_imputation}}.}

\item{whitelist.markers}{(optional) A whitelist containing CHROM (character or integer) and/or LOCUS (integer) and/or 
POS (integer) columns header. To filter by CHROM and/or locus and/or by snp.
The whitelist is in the directory (e.g. "whitelist.txt"). de novo CHROM column with 'un' need to be changed to 1.}

\item{blacklist.id}{(optional) A blacklist with individual ID and
a column header 'INDIVIDUALS'. The blacklist is in the directory
 (e.g. "blacklist.txt").}

\item{pop.levels}{(required) A character string with your populations ordered.}

\item{pop.labels}{(optional) A character string of your populations labels.
If you need to rename sampling sites in \code{pop.levels} or combined sites/pop
into a different names, here is the place.}

\item{pop.id.start}{The start of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{pop.id.end}{The end of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{strata}{(optional) A tab delimited file with 2 columns with header:
\code{INDIVIDUALS} and \code{STRATA}. Default: \code{strata = NULL}. 
This is especially useful if you have a hierarchical or factorial sampling 
design. See also \code{\link[adegenet]{genind}} for details.}

\item{pop.select}{(string) Conduct the assignment analysis on a
selected list of populations. Default = \code{NULL} for no selection and keep
all population.
e.g. \code{pop.select = "QUE"} to select QUE population samples.
\code{pop.select = c("QUE", "ONT")} to select QUE and ONT population samples.}

\item{blacklist.genotype}{(optional) Useful to erase genotype with below 
average quality, e.g. genotype with more than 2 alleles in diploid likely 
sequencing errors or genotypes with poor genotype likelihood or coverage. 
The blacklist as a minimum of 2 column headers (markers and individuals). 
Markers can be 1 column (CHROM or LOCUS or POS), 
a combination of 2 (e.g. CHROM and POS or CHROM and LOCUS or LOCUS and POS) or 
all 3 (CHROM, LOCUS, POS) The markers columns must be designated: CHROM (character
or integer) and/or LOCUS (integer) and/or POS (integer). The id column designated
INDIVIDUALS (character) columns header. The blacklist must be in the working 
directory (e.g. "blacklist.genotype.txt"). For de novo VCF, CHROM column 
with 'un' need to be changed to 1. Default \code{NULL} for no blacklist of 
genotypes to erase.}

\item{snp.ld}{(optional) Minimize linkage disequilibrium (LD) by choosing 
among these 3 options: \code{"random"} selection, \code{"first"} or 
\code{"last"} SNP on the same read/haplotype. Default = \code{NULL}.}

\item{common.markers}{(optional) Logical. Default = \code{FALSE}. 
With \code{TRUE}, will keep markers present in all the populations.}

\item{fasta.outgroup}{(optional) The fasta output file from STACKS. This file is 
required to use an outgroup. Default: \code{fasta.outgroup = NULL}.}

\item{fasta.ingroup}{(optional) The fasta output file from STACKS. This file is 
required to use with an outgroup. Leave empty if no outgroup. 
Default: \code{fasta.ingroup = NULL}.}

\item{sumstats.outgroup}{(optional) The sumstats output file from STACKS 
when running STACKS for the outgroup fasta file. This file is 
required to use an outgroup. Default: \code{sumstats.outgroup = NULL}.}

\item{sumstats.ingroup}{(optional) The sumstats output file from STACKS
when running STACKS for the ingroup fasta file.This file is 
required to use with an outgroup. Leave empty if no outgroup. 
Default: \code{sumstats.ingroup = NULL}.}

\item{dadi.input.filename}{(optional) Name of the \code{dadi} SNP input file 
written to the working directory. e.g. \code{dadi.file.txt}. 
Default use date and time to make the file. If used, the file extension
need to finish with \code{.txt}.}

\item{imputation.method}{Should a map-independent imputations of markers be
computed. Available choices are: (1) \code{FALSE} for no imputation.
(2) \code{"max"} to use the most frequent category for imputations.
(3) \code{"rf"} using Random Forest algorithm. Default = \code{FALSE}.}

\item{impute}{(character) Imputation on missing genotype 
\code{impute = "genotype"} or alleles \code{impute = "allele"}.}

\item{imputations.group}{\code{"global"} or \code{"populations"}.
Should the imputations be computed globally or by populations. If you choose
global, turn the verbose to \code{TRUE}, to see progress.
Default = \code{"populations"}.}

\item{num.tree}{The number of trees to grow in Random Forest. Default is 100.}

\item{iteration.rf}{The number of iterations of missing data algorithm 
in Random Forest. Default is 10.}

\item{split.number}{Non-negative integer value used to specify 
random splitting in Random Forest. Default is 100.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Should trace output be enabled on each iteration 
in Random Forest ? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{parallel.core}{(optional) The number of core for OpenMP shared-memory parallel
programming of Random Forest imputations. For more info on how to install the
OpenMP version see \code{\link[randomForestSRC]{randomForestSRC-package}}.
If not selected \code{detectCores()-1} is used as default.}

\description{
This function will create a \code{dadi} SNP input file and a 
joint allele frequency spectrum file (folded) using STACKS \code{batch_x.vcf} file
or an imputed vcf file see \code{\link[stackr]{vcf_imputation}}. If your VCF 
is not filtered, you can supply the function a whitelist of loci and a 
blacklist of individuals.
}
\details{
The imputations using Random Forest requires more time to compute and can take several
minutes and hours depending on the size of the dataset and polymorphism of
the species used. e.g. with a low polymorphic taxa, and a data set 
containing 30\% missing data, 5 000 haplotypes loci and 500 individuals 
will require 15 min.
