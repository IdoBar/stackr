\title{Coverage imbalance visual diagnostic.}
\usage{
figure_coverage_imbalance_diagnostic(tidy.vcf.file, pop.levels,
  read.depth.threshold, aes.colour, adjust.bin)
}
\arguments{
\item{tidy.vcf.file}{The tidy VCF file created with read_stacks_vcf.}

\item{pop.levels}{Character string defining your ordered populations.}

\item{read.depth.threshold}{Define the threshold you wish to analyse.}

\item{aes.colour}{GGPLOT2 aesthetics,
e.g. aes(y = ..count..).}

\item{adjust.bin}{Adjust GGPLOT2 bin size (0 to 1).}
}
\value{
4-plots highlighting the different combination of under
 or over the coverage threshold and mean genotype likelihood.
 Y- axis show the distribution of genotypes.
 X- axis show the coverage imbalance the
 Negative ratio (left x axis) : REF > ALT.
 Positive ratio (right x axis) : ALT > REF.
}
\description{
GBS data and STACKS pipeline sometimes output REF and ALT
alleles that have coverage imbalance, i.e. the coverage is not equal
and skewed towards the REF or ALT alleles.
Thw density distribution figure of coverage imbalance between REF and ALT
alleles will highlight the problem in you data.
}
\details{
The figures shows the results of the of coverage threshold
selected and mean genotype likelihood.
You can test different threshold to inspect your data.
Ideally the lower left pannel of the 4-plot should be empty. If it is, this
shows that setting the threshold of the genotype likelihood filter
to the mean or close to it take care of the allelic coverage imbalance.
#' e.g. fig <- figure_coverage_imbalance_diagnostic(
tidy.vcf.file, pop.levels, read.depth.threshold, aes.colour, adjust.bin)
Use ( fig + facet_grid(GROUP_GL ~ GROUP_COVERAGE)).
