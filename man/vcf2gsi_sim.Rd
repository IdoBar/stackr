\title{Use the STACKS VCF file to run assignment analysis in gsi_sim.}
\usage{
vcf2gsi_sim(vcf.file, whitelist.markers = NULL, snp.LD = NULL,
  common.markers = FALSE, marker.number = "all", sampling.method, THL,
  iterations = 10, blacklist.id = NULL, subsample = NULL,
  gsi_sim.filename = "gsi_sim_data.txt", keep.gsi.files, pop.levels,
  pop.labels, pop.id.start, pop.id.end, baseline = NULL, mixture = NULL,
  imputations = FALSE, imputations.group = "populations", num.tree = 100,
  iteration.rf = 10, split.number = 100, verbose = FALSE,
  parallel.core = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf.file}{The VCF file created by STACKS.}

\item{whitelist.markers}{(optional) A whitelist containing CHROM (character or integer) and/or LOCUS (integer) and/or 
POS (integer) columns header. To filter by CHROM and/or locus and/or by snp.
The whitelist is in the directory (e.g. "whitelist.txt"). de novo CHROM column with 'un' need to be changed to 1.}

\item{snp.LD}{(optional) Minimize linkage disequilibrium (LD) by choosing 
among these 3 options: \code{"random"} selection, \code{"first"} or 
\code{"last"} SNP on the same read/haplotype. Default = \code{NULL}.}

\item{common.markers}{(optional) Logical. Default = \code{FALSE}. 
With \code{TRUE}, will keep markers present in all the populations.}

\item{marker.number}{(Integer or string of number or "all") Calculations with 
fixed or subsample of your markers. Default= \code{"all"}.
e.g. To test 500, 1000, 2000 and all  the markers: 
\code{marker.number = c(500, 1000, 2000, "all"}. 
To use only 500 makers \code{marker.number = 500}.}

\item{sampling.method}{(character) Should the markers be randomly selected 
\code{"random"} for a classic Leave-One-Out (LOO) assignment or 
chosen based on ranked Fst \code{"ranked"}, used in a 
Traing-Holdout-Leave One Out (THL) assignment ?}

\item{THL}{(integer, proportion) For the \code{ranked} sampling method. 
Default \code{1}: 1 individual is used as holdout. This individual is not 
participating in the markers ranking. For each marker marker number, 
the analysis will be repeated with all the indiviuals in the data set 
(e.g. 500 individuals, 500 times 500, 1000, 2000 markers). 
If a proportion is used e.g. \code{0.15},= 15% of individuals in each 
populations are chosen randomly as holdout individuals. 
You can create different holdout individuals lists with the \code{iterations} 
argument.}

\item{iterations}{With random marker selection the iterations argument = 
the number of iterations to repeat marker resampling, default is \code{10} 
With \code{marker.number = c(500, 1000)} and default iterations setting, 
500 markers will be randomly chosen 10 times and 1000 markers will be randomly
chosen 10 times. For the ranked method, using \code{THL = 1}, the analysis 
will be repeated for each individuals in the data set for every 
\code{marker.number} selected. With a proportion argument \code{THL = 0.15},
15% of individuals in each populations are chosen randomly as holdout 
individuals and this process is reapeated the number of times chosen by the 
\code{iterations} value.}

\item{blacklist.id}{(optional) A blacklist with individual ID and
a column header 'INDIVIDUALS'. The blacklist is in the directory
 (e.g. "blacklist.txt").}

\item{gsi_sim.filename}{(optional) The name of the file written to the directory.
Use the extension ".txt" at the end. Default \code{gsi_sim_data.txt}.
The number of markers used will be appended to the name of the file.}

\item{keep.gsi.files}{(Boolean) Default \code{FALSE} The input and output gsi_sim files
will be deleted from the directory when finished processing. 
With \code{TRUE}, remember to allocate a large chunk of the disk space for the analysis.}

\item{pop.levels}{(required) A character string with your populations ordered.}

\item{pop.labels}{(optional) A character string of your populations labels.
If you need to rename sampling sites in \code{pop.levels} or combined sites/pop
into a different names, here is the place.}

\item{pop.id.start}{The start of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{pop.id.end}{The end of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{baseline}{(optional) A character string with your baseline id. 
From the \code{pop.id.start} and \code{pop.id.end} you isolate 
the baseline and mixture group. Here you need to give the id for 
baseline e.g. \code{c("QUE-ADU", "ONT-ADU")}.}

\item{mixture}{(optional) But required if bseline was selected. A character 
string with your mixture id. e.g. \code{c("QUE-JUV", "ONT-JUV")}.}

\item{imputations}{Should a map-independent imputations of markers be
computed. Available choices are: (1) \code{FALSE} for no imputation.
(2) \code{"max"} to use the most frequent category for imputations.
 (3) \code{"rf"} using Random Forest algorithm. Default = \code{FALSE}.}

\item{imputations.group}{\code{"global"} or \code{"populations"}.
Should the imputations be computed globally or by populations. If you choose
global, turn the verbose to \code{TRUE}, to see progress.
Default = \code{"populations"}.}

\item{num.tree}{The number of trees to grow in Random Forest. Default is 100.}

\item{iteration.rf}{The number of iterations of missing data algorithm 
in Random Forest. Default is 10.}

\item{split.number}{Non-negative integer value used to specify 
random splitting in Random Forest. Default is 100.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Should trace output be enabled on each iteration 
in Random Forest ? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{parallel.core}{(optional) The number of core for OpenMP shared-memory parallel
programming of Random Forest imputations. For more info on how to install the
OpenMP version see \code{\link[randomForestSRC]{randomForestSRC-package}}.
If not selected \code{detectCores()-1} is used as default.}
}
\value{
When no imputation is selected a gsi_sim file is saved to the 
working directory. When imputation is selected 2 gsi_sim files are saved to
the working directory.

\description{
\code{gsi_sim} is a tool for doing and simulating genetic stock identification. 
The \code{vcf2gsi_sim} function can first filter the VCF file 
with a whitelist of markers and a blacklist of individuals. 
Map-independent imputation using Random Forest or the most frequent category
is also available as an option.
}
\details{
The imputations using Random Forest requires more time to compute 
and can take several
minutes and hours depending on the size of the dataset and polymorphism of
the species used. e.g. with a low polymorphic taxa, and a data set 
containing 30\% missing data, 5 000 haplotypes loci and 500 individuals 
will require 15 min.
The Fst is based on Weir and Cockerham 1984 equations.
