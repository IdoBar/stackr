}
\arguments{
\item{assignment.lmax}{The file with likelihood ratio assignment results
from GENODIVE.}

\item{assignment.lhome}{The file with home likelihood assignment results
from GENODIVE.}

\item{lmax.migrant.skip}{The number of lines to skip before the migrant
info in the likelihood ratio assignment results. Usually = 11.}

\item{lmax.number.migrant}{The number of migrant detected
in the likelihood ratio assignment results.}

\item{lmax.skip}{The number of lines to skip before the individuals info
in the likelihood ratio assignment results.}

\item{lhome.migrant.skip}{The number of lines to skip before 
the migrant info in the home likelihood assignment results. Usually = 11.}

\item{lhome.number.migrant}{The number of migrant detected
in the home likelihood assignment results.}

\item{lhome.skip}{The number of lines to skip before the individuals info 
in the home likelihood assignment results.}

\item{sites.levels}{An optional character string with your sites names in 
the same order as the pop levels.}

\item{pop.labels}{The pop label to identify your sampling sites.}

\item{pop.levels}{An optional character string with your populations ordered.}

\item{pop.id.start}{The start of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{pop.id.end}{The end of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{number.individuals}{The number of individuals analysed.}

\item{number.pop}{The number of populations analysed.}

\description{
Import assignment results from GENODIVE. 
Current version needs results from both statistics, the home likelihood 
and likelihood ratio.
