\usage{
missing_genotypes(haplotypes.file, whitelist.loci = NULL,
  erase.paralogs = NULL, pop.id.start, pop.id.end, pop.levels, pop.labels,
  missing.geno.threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{haplotypes.file}{The 'batch_x.haplotypes.tsv' created by STACKS.}

\item{whitelist.loci}{(optional) A whitelist of loci with a column header 
'LOCUS'. If the whitelist is written in the directory 
\code{whitelist.loci = "whitelist.txt"}. If the whitelist is in 
the global environment \code{whitelist.loci = whitelist.1000loci}}

\item{erase.paralogs}{(logical) \code{FALSE} Loci with more than 2 alleles 
(paralogs and/or sequencing errors) will be removed. \code{TRUE} genotypes 
with more than 2 alleles (paralogs and/or sequencing errors) will be erased.}

\item{pop.id.start}{The start of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{pop.id.end}{The end of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{pop.levels}{A character string with your populations ordered.}

\item{pop.labels}{An optional character string with new populations names.}

\item{missing.geno.threshold}{(integer) Percentage of missing genotype 
allowed per individuals. e.g. for a maximum of 30% of missing genotype 
per individuals \code{missing.geno.threshold = 30}.}
}
\value{
a list with 4 data frames: $missing.genotypes.ind,
$missing.genotypes.pop, $blacklisted.id, $plot.missing.
}
\description{
Use this function to have a summary of missing genotypes 
per individuals and per population. Density distribution plot of misssing
information is produced. This function also create a blacklist
of individuals based on the desired threshold of missing genotype. 
When a whitelist of loci is provided, \code{_filtered} will be appended 
to the filename. Locus with more than 3 alleles (paralogs and/or sequencing errors) can be deleted or 
genotypes with more than 3 alleles can be erased.
}
\details{
For the plot, to see the information with the popualtion in 
different facet, use \code{+facet_wrap(~POP_ID, nrow=2,ncol=5)} 
after the object of the plot, e.g. \code{fig <- missing$plot.missing}, to have
facet by pop \code{fig +facet_wrap(~POP_ID, nrow=2,ncol=5)}
where \code{nrow} and \code{ncol} in this exeample would spread 
the 10 populations on 2 rows and 5 columns.
