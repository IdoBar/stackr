\arguments{
\item{data}{9 options: biallelic and haplotypic vcf
(to make vcf population ready, see details below),
plink, stacks haplotype file, genind (library(adegenet)), 
genlight (library(adegenet)), gtypes (library(strataG)), genepop, 
and a data frame in wide format. 
\emph{See details} of \code{\link{tidy_genomic_data}}.}

\item{allele.threshold}{(integer) Threshold of alternate allele copies.
Below this threshold markers are blacklisted. Choose this threshold based
on your tolerance for uninformative or unreliable information and 
minor allele frequency. Summary statistics for this blacklist will be calculated.
See details for more info.}

\item{whitelist.markers}{(optional) A whitelist containing CHROM (character
or integer) and/or LOCUS (integer) and/or
POS (integer) columns header. To filter by chromosome and/or locus and/or by snp.
The whitelist is in the working directory (e.g. "whitelist.txt").
de novo CHROM column with 'un' need to be changed to 1. 
In the VCF, the column ID is the LOCUS identification.
Default \code{whitelist.markers = NULL} for no whitelist of markers.}

\item{monomorphic.out}{(optional) Should the monomorphic 
markers present in the dataset be filtered out ? 
Default: \code{monomorphic.out = TRUE}.}

\item{blacklist.genotype}{(optional) Useful to erase genotype with below 
average quality, e.g. genotype with more than 2 alleles in diploid likely 
sequencing errors or genotypes with poor genotype likelihood or coverage. 
The blacklist has a minimum of 2 column headers (markers and individuals). 
Markers can be 1 column (CHROM or LOCUS or POS), 
a combination of 2 (e.g. CHROM and POS or CHROM and LOCUS or LOCUS and POS) or 
all 3 (CHROM, LOCUS, POS). The markers columns must be designated: CHROM (character
or integer) and/or LOCUS (integer) and/or POS (integer). The id column designated
INDIVIDUALS (character) columns header. The blacklist must be in the working 
directory (e.g. "blacklist.genotype.txt"). For de novo VCF, CHROM column 
with 'un' need to be changed to 1. 
Default: \code{blacklist.genotype = NULL} for no blacklist of 
genotypes to erase.}

\item{snp.ld}{(optional) \strong{For VCF file only}. 
SNP short distance linkage disequilibrium pruning. With anonymous markers from
RADseq/GBS de novo discovery, you can minimize linkage disequilibrium (LD) by
choosing among these 3 options: \code{"random"} selection, \code{"first"} or
\code{"last"} SNP on the same short read/haplotype. For long distance linkage
disequilibrium pruning, see details below.
Default: \code{snp.ld = NULL}.}

\item{common.markers}{(optional) Logical. Default: \code{common.markers = TRUE}, 
will only keep markers in common (genotyped) between all the populations.}

\item{maf.thresholds}{(string, double, optional) String with 
local/populations and global/overall maf thresholds, respectively.
e.g. \code{maf.thresholds = c(0.05, 0.1)} for a local maf threshold 
of 0.05 and a global threshold of 0.1. Available for VCF, PLINK and data frame 
files.
Default: \code{maf.thresholds = NULL}.}

\item{maf.pop.num.threshold}{(integer, optional) When maf thresholds are used,
this argument is for the number of pop required to pass the maf thresholds
to keep the locus. Default: \code{maf.pop.num.threshold = 1}}

\item{maf.approach}{(character, optional). 
\code{maf.approach = "haplotype"} : looks at the minimum MAF found on the 
read/haplotype. Using this option will discard all the markers/snp on 
that read based on the thresholds chosen. This method is only available 
for VCF and haplotype files, or tidy data frame from those file types.
\code{maf.approach = "SNP"} : treats all the SNP on the same 
haplotype/read as independent. Doesn't work with haplotype file, 
but does work for all other file type.
Default is \code{maf.approach = "SNP"}.}

\item{maf.operator}{(character, optional) \code{maf.operator = "AND"} or 
default \code{maf.operator = "OR"}.
When filtering over LOCUS or SNP, do you want the local \code{"AND"}
global MAF to pass the thresholds, or ... you want the local \code{"OR"}
global MAF to pass the thresholds, to keep the marker?}

\item{max.marker}{An optional integer useful to subsample marker number in 
large PLINK file. e.g. if the data set 
contains 200 000 markers and \code{max.marker = 10000} 10000 markers are
subsampled randomly from the 200000 markers. Use \code{whitelist.markers} to
keep specific markers.
Default: \code{max.marker = NULL}.}

\item{blacklist.id}{(optional) A blacklist with individual ID and
a column header 'INDIVIDUALS'. The blacklist is in the working directory
(e.g. "blacklist.txt").
Default: \code{blacklist.id = NULL}.}

\item{pop.levels}{(optional, string) This refers to the levels in a factor. In this 
case, the id of the pop.
Use this argument to have the pop ordered your way instead of the default 
alphabetical or numerical order. e.g. \code{pop.levels = c("QUE", "ONT", "ALB")} 
instead of the default \code{pop.levels = c("ALB", "ONT", "QUE")}. 
White spaces in population names are replaced by underscore.
Default: \code{pop.levels = NULL}.}

\item{pop.labels}{(optional, string) Use this argument to rename/relabel
your pop or combine your pop. e.g. To combine \code{"QUE"} and \code{"ONT"} 
into a new pop called \code{"NEW"}:
(1) First, define the levels for your pop with \code{pop.levels} argument: 
\code{pop.levels = c("QUE", "ONT", "ALB")}. 
(2) then, use \code{pop.labels} argument: 
\code{pop.levels = c("NEW", "NEW", "ALB")}.
To rename \code{"QUE"} to \code{"TAS"}:
\code{pop.labels = c("TAS", "ONT", "ALB")}.
Default: \code{pop.labels = NULL}. If you find this too complicated, there is also the
\code{strata} argument that can do the same thing, see below.
White spaces in population names are replaced by underscore.}

\item{strata}{(optional/required) Required for VCF and haplotypes files, 
optional for the other file formats supported. 

The strata file is a tab delimited file with 2 columns with header:
\code{INDIVIDUALS} and \code{STRATA}. With a 
data frame of genotypes the strata is the INDIVIDUALS and POP_ID columns, with
PLINK files, the \code{tfam} first 2 columns are used. 
If a \code{strata} file is specified, the strata file will have
precedence. The \code{STRATA} column can be any hierarchical grouping. 
To create a strata file see \code{\link[stackr]{individuals2strata}}.
If you have already run 
\href{http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/}{stacks} on your data, 
the strata file is similar to a stacks `population map file`, make sure you 
have the required column names (\code{INDIVIDUALS} and \code{STRATA}).
Default: \code{strata = NULL}.}

\item{pop.select}{(string, optional) Selected list of populations for
the analysis. e.g. \code{pop.select = c("QUE", "ONT")} to select \code{QUE}
and \code{ONT} population samples (out of 20 pops).
Default: \code{pop.select = NULL}}

\item{filename}{(optional) The file name for the tidy data frame
written to the working directory.
Default: \code{filename = NULL}, the tidy data is 
in the global environment only (i.e. not written in the working directory).}

\item{verbose}{(optional, logical) When \code{verbose = TRUE} 
the function is a little more chatty during execution.
Default: \code{verbose = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with summary, plot and blacklist.
Summary statistics for the blacklisted markers are generated and include 
coverage and genotype likelihood information.

\code{$alt.allele.count.plot}: Distribution of marker's alternate allele number.
The shape is usually skewed right.

\code{$alt.depth.count.distribution.plot}: Distribution of markers alternate
allele depth (in number of read). The range showed on the plot is
between 1 and 10, and you decide your tolerance for low coverage 
and good genotype calls.

This plot is associated with \code{$number.markers}, a table that shows the
number of markers <= \code{allele.threshold }. Also in the table, the 
range of alternate allele read depth (1 to 10), same as plot but showing here
the the cumulative number of markers. Again, would you trust a marker with only
1 alternate allele (an heterozygote individual) with a read depth of 1 or 2 ?

\description{
Detect alternate allele problems.
Used internally in \href{https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr}{stackr} 
and might be of interest for users. The function computes alternate allele
counts and looks for alternate alleles bellow a certain threshold. 
The summary statistics for the
markers with problematic allele is computed based on coverage and
genotype likelihood. This function is very fast to highlight: i) bias in
representation of allelic copies and unequal coverage and ii) type I error 
during genotyping of heterozygote with low coverage data.

\strong{Under developement, use with caution}


\strong{Input files:} see \pkg{stackr} \code{\link[stackr]{tidy_genomic_data}}
for detailed information about supported file format.


\strong{allele.threshold}:

An \code{allele.threshold = 1}, says that you want to check the statistics 
for markers with only 1 copy of the alternate allele. Said differently,
\code{allele.threshold = 1} = only 1 heterozygote individual is making this
marker polymorphic, very thin line if this allele is backed by less than 3 reads.

Similarly, a \code{allele.threshold = 2} can represent markers with
2 heterozygote individuals calling the polymorphic markers or 1 individual
homozygote for the alternate allele.


Look for problem with :
\itemize{
\item read depth/coverage problem
\item high imbalance between the alt and ref depth coverage
\item genotype likelihood abnormally lower than normal
\item alternate allele with NA for read depth information
}

\strong{Alternate allele with no depth information:}
You can highlight those problematic genotypes with
alt.no.depth <- dplyr::filter(your.object$allele.summary, is.na(ALLELE_ALT_DEPTH))


Use the summary statistics of the blacklisted markers to refine update
the blacklist of markers. You can decide to discard the markers or
blacklist the problematic genotypes.
\pkg{stackr} \code{\link[stackr]{tidy_genomic_data}} and 
\code{\link[stackr]{genomic_converter}} allows to erase problematic genotypes
using a blacklist of genotypes...
