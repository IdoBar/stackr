\usage{
summary_haplotypes(haplotypes.file, whitelist.loci = NULL,
  blacklist.id = NULL, pop.id.start, pop.id.end, pop.levels, pop.labels,
  read.length)
}
\arguments{
\item{haplotypes.file}{The 'batch_x.haplotypes.tsv' created by STACKS.}

\item{whitelist.loci}{(optional) A whitelist of loci with a column name
'LOCUS'. The whitelist is located in the global environment or in the directory (e.g. "whitelist.txt"). 
If a whitelist is used, the files written to the directory will have 
'.filtered' in the filename.}

\item{blacklist.id}{(optional) A blacklist with individual ID and
a column header 'INDIVIDUALS'. The blacklist is in the global environment 
or in the directory (with "blacklist.txt").}

\item{pop.id.start}{The start of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{pop.id.end}{The end of your population id 
in the name of your individual sample.}

\item{pop.levels}{An optional character string with your populations ordered.}

\item{pop.labels}{An optional character string with new populations names.}

\item{read.length}{The length in nucleotide of your reads (e.g. 80 or 100).}

\value{
The function returns a list with the summary, the paralogs and
consensus loci by populations and unique loci, the individual's info for FH and Pi and 3 plots (use $ to access each 
objects). 
Write 3 files in the working directory:
blacklist of unique putative paralogs and unique consensus loci 
and a summary of the haplotypes file by population.
}
\description{
STACKS batch_x.haplotypes.tsv file summary.
The output of the function is a summary table for populations with putative
paralogs, consensus, monomorphic and polymorphic loci. Detected paralogs are 
removed while estimating the subsequent statistics.
The haplotypes statistics for the observed and expected homozygosity and
heterozygosity. Wright’s inbreeding coefficient (Fis), and a proxy measure of 
the realized proportion of the genome that is identical by descent (IBDG),
the FH measure based on the excess in the observed number of homozygous
genotypes within an individual relative to the mean number of homozygous 
genotypes expected under random mating 
(Keller et al., 2011; Kardos et al., 2015). 
The nucleotide diversity (Pi) is also given. Pi measured here consider the 
consensus loci in the catalog (no variation between population sequences).
