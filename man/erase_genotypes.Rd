\title{Erase genotypes.}
\usage{
erase_genotypes(data, is.tidy.vcf, blacklist.genotypes, filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The 'batch_x.haplotypes.tsv' or a tidy vcf file.}

\item{is.tidy.vcf}{Using a tidy VCF file: TRUE or FALSE.}

\item{blacklist.genotypes}{A blacklist of loci and genotypes
containing at least 2 columns header 'LOCUS' and 'INDIVIDUALS'. The file is

\description{
This function erase the genotypes of individuals
based on coverage and genotype likelihood thresholds.
}

Genotypes below average quality i.e. below threshold for the
coverage of REF and/or ALT allele and genotype likelihood
are zeroed from the file. The function erase SNP in the VCF file and loci
in the haplotypes file.
