This is the development page of the **stackr**, an R package who's goal is
to make GBS/RAD data easy to analyse inside R.

## Use stackr to:

* **Input**: various file formats are supported (VCF, PLINK tped/tfam, genind, genlight, genepop, haplotype file produced by [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) and data frame of genotypes)
* **Explore**, **manipulate** and **visualize**: 
Caracteristics and statistics for important variables of GBS/RADseq data are available: read depth (coverage) of alleles and 
genotypes, genotype likelihood, genotyped individuals and populations, missing data, minor allele frequency (local and global MAF),
observed heterozygosity (Het obs) and inbreeding coefficient (Fis), duplicate individual, etc.
* **Filters**: avoid bad data exploration and control the impact of filters on your downstream genetic analysis. 
Alleles, genotypes, markers, individuals and populations can be filtered and/or selected in several ways.
* **Imputations**: Map-independent imputation of missing genotype/alleles 
using Random Forest or the most frequent category
* **Output**: painless conversion process. Conversion functions are integrated with important filters, blacklist and whitelist to convert genomic dataset in a **tidy** format and/or into *VCF*, *PLINK* , *genepop*, *genind*, *genlight*, *hierfstat*, *gtypes*, *betadiv* and *dadi* formats. 
Easy integration with other software or R packages like [adegenet] (https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet), [strataG] (https://github.com/EricArcher/strataG.devel/tree/master/strataG.devel), [hierfstat] (https://github.com/jgx65/hierfstat), [pegas] (https://github.com/emmanuelparadis/pegas), [poppr] (https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr) and [assigner](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/assigner)
* `ggplot2`-based plotting to view distributions of summary statistics and create publication-ready figures

 
## Installation
To try out the dev version of **stackr**, copy/paste the code below:

```r
# Install or load the package **devtools**
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # to install
library(devtools) # to load
# Install **stackr**
# devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr") # to install without vignettes
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr", build_vignettes = TRUE)  # to install WITH vignettes
library(stackr) # to load
```

## Prerequisite - Suggestions - Troubleshooting
  * **Parallel computing**: Follow the steps in this [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_imputations_parallel.Rmd) 
  to install an OpenMP enabled [randomForestSRC](http://www.ccs.miami.edu/~hishwaran/rfsrc.html)
 package to do imputations in parallel.
  * **Installation problem:** see this
  [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_installation_problems.Rmd)
  * **Windows users**:  to have *stackr* run in parallel use [parallelsugar](https://github.com/nathanvan/parallelsugar).
  Easy to install and use ([instructions](https://github.com/nathanvan/parallelsugar#installation)).
  * For a better experience in **stackr** and in R in general, I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 
  The R GUI is unstable with functions using parallel ([more info](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mclapply.html)). 
  Below, the combination of packages and how I install/load them :
  
  ```r
  if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
  library("pacman")
  pacman::p_load(devtools, reshape2, ggplot2, stringr, stringi, plyr, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, data.table, ape, adegenet, parallel, lazyeval, randomForestSRC, hierfstat, strataG)
  pacman::p_load(devtools, reshape2, ggplot2, stringr, stringi, plyr, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, data.table, ape, adegenet, parallel, lazyeval, randomForestSRC, hierfstat, strataG)
  # install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr", build_vignettes = TRUE) # uncomment to install
  library("stackr")
  ```

## New features
Version, new feature and bug history now lives in the [NEWS.md file] (https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/NEWS.md)

**v.0.3.0**
* Update that makes my coding life easier.
* Several internal functions to convert from a tidy dataframe to:
`vcf`, `plink`, `genind`, `genlight`, `gtypes`, `hierfstat`, `genepop`, `structure` and `betadiv` 
are now separate modules available to users (look for `write_...` with the outputformat)
* New function `genomic_converter`: If you want the to convert from the supported 
input file formats to many output formats, at once, this is the function. 
With the new function `genomic_converter`, import and imputations is only 
done once, saving time if you were generating different output WITH imputations.
* Change: all the `vcf2...` functions (excep `vcf2dadi`) are now a shorcut of `genomic_converter`. 
 This is particularly interesting and faster if you were generating different
 output WITH imputations.
* Deprecated: the `haplo2...` functions are all deprecated and replaced by 
`genomic_converter`, **except haplo2colony** that requires so many arguments that it 
would be too complicated, for now, to integrate with `genomic_converter`.
* New feature: when selecting populations and/or using a blacklist of ID and/or 
after imputations, the REF and ALT alleles are now re-computed to account for the filters and imputations.

## Roadmap of future developments:

* Until publication **stackr** will change rapidly (see contributions below for bug reports).
* Updated filters: more efficient, interactive and visualization included: *in progress*
* Better integration with other GBS/RADseq approaches, beside [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/): *in progress* 
* Integrated converter function to input and output several file formats: *done*
* Workflow tutorial that links functions and points to specific vignettes to further explore some problems: *in progress*
* Integration of several functions with [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) and [DArT](http://www.diversityarrays.com) database.
* Use Shiny and ggvis when subplots or facets becomes available...
* Suggestions ?

## GBS workflow
The **stackr** package fits currently at the end of the GBS workflow. Below, a flow chart using [STACKS] (http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) and other software. You can use the [STACKS] (http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) workflow [used in the Bernatchez lab] (https://github.com/enormandeau/stacks_workflow). ![](vignettes/GBS_workflow.png)

## stackr workflow 
Currently under construction. Come back soon!

**Table 1: Quality control and filtering RAD/GBS data**

| Parameter | Libraries/Seq.Lanes | Allele | Genotype | Individual | Sampling sites | Populations | Globally |
|:----|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Quality | x | | | | | | |
| Coverage | | x | x | | | | |
| Genotype Likelihood | | | x | | | | |
| Prop. Genotyped | | | | x | x | x | x |
| MAF | | | | | x | x | x |
| HET | | | | | | x | |
| FIS | | | | | | x | |
| SNP number/reads | | | | | | | x |


Step 1 as a quality insurance step. We need to modify the data to play with it efficiently in R. To have reliable summary statistics, you first need good coverage of your alleles to call your genotypes, good genotype likelihood, enough individuals in each sampling sites and enough putative populations with your markers... 

Step 2 is where the actual work is done to remove artifactual and uninformative markers based on summary statistics of your markers.
