## Use stackr to: import, explore, manipulate, filter, impute, visualize and export your GBS/RADseq data

* **Import/Export** your GBS/RADseq data with the various supported genomic file formats: *tidy*, *wide*, *VCF*, *PLINK* , *genepop*, *genind*, *genlight*, *hierfstat*, *gtypes*, *betadiv*, *dadi* and the haplotype file produced by [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/). 
Easy integration with other software or R packages like [adegenet] (https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet), [strataG] (https://github.com/EricArcher/strataG.devel/tree/master/strataG.devel), [hierfstat] (https://github.com/jgx65/hierfstat), [pegas] (https://github.com/emmanuelparadis/pegas), [poppr] (https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr) and [assigner](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/assigner). 
Conversion functions are integrated with important filters, blacklist and whitelist.

* **Explore** and **filter** important variables caracteristics and statistics:
    * missing data,
    * read depth (coverage) of alleles and genotypes, 
    * genotype likelihood,
    * genotyped individuals and populations,
    * minor allele frequency (local and global MAF),
    * observed heterozygosity (Het obs) and inbreeding coefficient (Fis),
    * find duplicate individual and mixed samples.

* **Filter**: Most genomic analysis look for patterns and trends with various statistics. 
Bias, noise and outliers can have bounded influence on estimators and interfere with polymorphism discovery. 
Avoid bad data exploration and control the impact of filters on your downstream genetic analysis.
Alleles, genotypes, markers, individuals and populations can be filtered and/or selected in several ways.

* **Map-independent imputation** of missing genotype/alleles 
using Random Forest or the most frequent category.

* **Visualization:** `ggplot2`-based plotting for publication-ready figures.

 
## Installation
To try out the dev version of **stackr**, copy/paste the code below:

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # to install
library(devtools) # to load
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr", build_vignettes = TRUE)  # to install WITH vignettes
library(stackr) # to load
```

## Prerequisite - Suggestions - Troubleshooting
  * **Parallel computing**: Follow the steps in this [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_imputations_parallel.Rmd) 
  to install an OpenMP enabled [randomForestSRC](http://www.ccs.miami.edu/~hishwaran/rfsrc.html)
 package to do imputations in parallel.
  * **Installation problem:** see this
  [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_installation_problems.Rmd)
  * **Windows users**:  1. Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). 2. To have *stackr* run in parallel, use [parallelsugar](https://github.com/nathanvan/parallelsugar).
  Easy to install and use ([instructions](https://github.com/nathanvan/parallelsugar#installation)).
  * For a better experience in **stackr** and in R in general, I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 
  The R GUI is unstable with functions using parallel ([more info](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mclapply.html)). 
  Below, the combination of packages and how I install/load them :
  
  ```r
  if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
  library("pacman")
  pacman::p_load(devtools, reshape2, ggplot2, stringr, stringi, plyr, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, data.table, ape, adegenet, parallel, lazyeval, randomForestSRC, hierfstat, strataG)
  pacman::p_load(devtools, reshape2, ggplot2, stringr, stringi, plyr, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, data.table, ape, adegenet, parallel, lazyeval, randomForestSRC, hierfstat, strataG)
  # install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr", build_vignettes = TRUE) # uncomment to install
  library("stackr")
  ```

vignette("vignette_vcf2dadi") # To open specific vignette
```

Vignettes are in development, check periodically for updates.

## New features
Change log, version, new features and bug history now lives in the [NEWS.md file] (https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/NEWS.md)

**v.0.3.5**
* updated tidy_genepop to read other flavors of the famous file format
* extracted a code block to create a new function called `tidy_fstat`

**v.0.3.4**
* updated documentation
* bug fix in `summary_haplotypes` introduced by the new version of `dplyr::distinct` (v.0.5.0)
* calculations of Pi is done in parallel inside `summary_haplotypes`

**v.0.3.3**
* `tidy_genomic_data`: added a check that throws an error when pop.levels != the pop.id in strata

**v.0.3.2**
* `genomic_converter` including all the `vcf2...` function can now use phase/unphase genotypes.
Some **pyRAD** vcf (e.g. v.3.0.64) have a mix of GT format with `/` and `|`. 
e.g. missing GT  = `./.` and genotyped individuals = `0|0`. 
I'm not sure it follows [VCF specification](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf), 
but **stackr** can now read those vcf files.
* `vcf2dadi` is more user-friendly for scientist with in- and out-group metadata, using STACKS or not.

## Roadmap of future developments:

* Until publication **stackr** will change rapidly (see contributions below for bug reports).
* Updated filters: more efficient, interactive and visualization included: *in progress*
* Better integration with other GBS/RADseq approaches, beside [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/): *in progress* 
* Integrated converter function to input and output several file formats: *done*
* Workflow tutorial that links functions and points to specific vignettes to further explore some problems: *in progress*
* Integration of several functions with [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) and [DArT](http://www.diversityarrays.com) database.
* Use Shiny and ggvis when subplots or facets becomes available...
* Suggestions ?

## GBS workflow
The **stackr** package fits currently at the end of the GBS workflow. Below, a flow chart using [STACKS] (http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) and other software. You can use the [STACKS] (http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) workflow [used in the Bernatchez lab] (https://github.com/enormandeau/stacks_workflow). ![](vignettes/GBS_workflow.png)

## stackr workflow 
Currently under construction. Come back soon!

**Table 1: Quality control and filtering RAD/GBS data**

| Parameter | Libraries/Seq.Lanes | Allele | Genotype | Individual | Sampling sites | Populations | Globally |
|:----|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Quality | x | | | | | | |
| Coverage | | x | x | | | | |
| Genotype Likelihood | | | x | | | | |
| Prop. Genotyped | | | | x | x | x | x |
| MAF | | | | | x | x | x |
| HET | | | | | | x | |
| FIS | | | | | | x | |
| SNP number/reads | | | | | | | x |


Step 1 as a quality insurance step. We need to modify the data to play with it efficiently in R. To have reliable summary statistics, you first need good coverage of your alleles to call your genotypes, good genotype likelihood, enough individuals in each sampling sites and enough putative populations with your markers... 

Step 2 is where the actual work is done to remove artifactual and uninformative markers based on summary statistics of your markers.
