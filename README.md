# stackr

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thierrygosselin/stackr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thierrygosselin/stackr) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.19647.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19647)


The goal of **stackr** is to make GBS/RAD data produced by [STACKS] (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) easy to analyse in R.

This is the development page of the **stackr** package for the R software.

* Optimized for *de novo* and population genetics
* Read and modify *batch_x.sumstats.tsv* and *batch_x.haplotypes.tsv* files.
* Transform the VCF file, *batch_x.vcf*, into a tidy format to visualise and filter summary statistics within R.
* Filters genetic markers based on: coverage (read depth, REF and ALT allele depth), genotype likelihood, the number of individuals, the number of populations, minor allele frequency (local and global), observed heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficient (Fis).
* View distribution of summary statistics and create publication-ready figures
* Convert data into *genepop*, *genind* and *gtypes* object for easy integration with [adegenet] (https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet), [strataG] (https://github.com/EricArcher/strataG.devel/tree/master/strataG.devel), [hierfstat] (https://github.com/jgx65/hierfstat), [pegas] (https://github.com/emmanuelparadis/pegas) and [poppr] (https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr).
* Map-independent imputation of GBS markers using Random Forest is now integrated within the *haplo2genepop*, *haplo2genind* and *haplo2gtypes* functions. 

## Roadmap of what's up next

* Documentation and vignette.
* Tutorial of workflow.
* Use Shiny and ggvis when subplots or facet available.
* Linkage map tools.
* CRAN.
* Interaction with [STACKS] (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) database (Web-interface).
* Reference genome tools.
* Maybe try some integration with other GBS approaches: AftrRAD, pyRAD, dDocent.
* Got ideas ?


## Installation
You can try out the dev version of **stackr**. You will need the package *devtools* and the dev version of *readr*

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("hadley/readr")
library(readr)
install_github("EricArcher/strataG.devel/strataG.devel")
library(strataG.devel)
install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr")
library(stackr)
```

On Mac OSX using a version of clang (the native compiler) with OpenMP greatly reduce the computation time for the imputation. There is a GCC version with OpenMP but it's highly unstable in R. To update your computer's compiler, follow the instruction below (inspired from [here](https://clang-omp.github.io)). In the terminal:

```r
cd Downloads
git clone https://github.com/clang-omp/llvm
git clone https://github.com/clang-omp/compiler-rt llvm/projects/compiler-rt
git clone -b clang-omp https://github.com/clang-omp/clang llvm/tools/clang

cd llvm
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

You new to tell R which compilers to use. Use TextWrangler or follow the lines below:
```r
cd ~
nano .R/Makevars
```

Enter the text below:
```r
CC=clang
CXX=clang++
PKG_CFLAGS=-g -O2
PKG_CXXFLAGS=-g -O2 -stdlib=libc++
```
Save and Exit with: crt-o, enterm crt-x


Install all package using Rcpp and/or OpenMP preferably with the with the same compiler.

```r
install.packages("Rcpp", type = "source")
install.packages("dplyr", type = "source")
install.packages("randomForestSRC", type = "source")
```

## GBS workflow
The **stackr** package fits currently at the end of the GBS workflow. Below, a flow chart using [STACKS] (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) and other software. You can use the [STACKS] (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) workflow [used in the Bernatchez lab] (https://github.com/enormandeau/stacks_workflow). ![](vignettes/GBS_workflow.png)
