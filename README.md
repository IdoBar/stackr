# stackr

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thierrygosselin/stackr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thierrygosselin/stackr) 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/14548/thierrygosselin/stackr.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/14548/thierrygosselin/stackr)

The goal of **stackr** is to make GBS/RAD data produced by [STACKS] (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) easy to analyse in R.

This is the development page of the **stackr** package for the R software, optimized for *de novo* and population genetics.

**Use stackr to:**
* Read and modify *batch_x.sumstats.tsv* and *batch_x.haplotypes.tsv* files
* Transform the VCF file, *batch_x.vcf*, into a tidy format to visualise and filter summary statistics within R
* Filters genetic markers based on: coverage (read depth, REF and ALT allele depth), genotype likelihood, number of individuals, number of populations, minor allele frequency (local and global), observed heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficient (Fis)
* `ggplot2`-based plotting to view distributions of summary statistics and create publication-ready figures
* Convert data into *genepop*, *genind*, *fstat*, and *gtypes* object for easy integration with [adegenet] (https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet), [strataG] (https://github.com/EricArcher/strataG.devel/tree/master/strataG.devel), [hierfstat] (https://github.com/jgx65/hierfstat), [pegas] (https://github.com/emmanuelparadis/pegas) and [poppr] (https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr)
* Impute GBS markers without a genetic map using Random Forest within the *haplo2genepop*, *haplo2genind*, *haplo2fstat*, *haplo2gtypes* and *haplo2colony* functions 

**Requirement:**
Because STACKS is always under development (more than 100 versions so far!), 
**stackr** will work best with Stacks version >= 1.29.

## New
**v.0.1.5**
Introducing *haplo2gsi_sim* function.
* Conversion of STACKS haplotypes file into a gsi_sim data input file.
* Markers can be subsampled.
* Map-independent imputations using Random Forest or the most frequent allele are options also available for this function.
* [gsi_sim] (https://github.com/eriqande/gsi_sim) is a tool developed by Eric C. Anderson for doing and simulating genetic stock identification.

**v.0.1.4**
Introducing *haplo2fstat* function.
Conversion of STACKS haplotypes file into a fstat file.
Access all the functions in the R package [hierfstat] (https://github.com/jgx65/hierfstat).

**v.0.1.3**
Map-independent imputations of a VCF file created by STACKS. 
Two options are available for imputations: using Random Forest or the most frequent allele.

Before imputations, the VCF file can be filtered with:

* a whitelist of loci (to keep only specific loci...)
* a blacklist of individuals (to remove individuals or entire populations...)
* also, a list of genotypes with bad coverage and/or genotype likelihood can be supplied to erase the genotypes before imputations (for more details look at the function: blacklist_erase_genotype).

**v.0.1.2**
**The *summary_haplotypes* function now outputs:**
* Putative paralogs, consensus, monomorphic and polymorphic loci
* The haplotype statistics for the observed and expected homozygosity and 
heterozygosity
* Wright’s inbreeding coefficient (Fis)
* Proxy measure of the realized proportion of the genome that is identical
by descent (IBDG). The FH measure is based on the excess in the observed number
of homozygous genotypes within an individual relative to the mean number of 
homozygous genotypes expected under random mating (Keller et al., 2011; 
Kardos et al., 2015).
* Nucleotide diversity (Pi), considering the consensus loci in the catalog 
(i.e. reads with no variation between population). It's Nei & Li (1979) 
function, adapted to the GBS reality.

**The *haplo2colony* function**
* Converts the file to the required *COLONY* input file
* Can filter the haplotypes file with a whitelist of loci 
and a blacklist of individuals
* Can impute the data with Random Forest or the most frequent category
* Use the *print.all.colony.opt* to output all COLONY options to the file.
This however requires manual curation of the file to work directly with COLONY. 

## Roadmap of future developments:

* Very soon: Joint Allele Frequency Spectrum from a *batch_x.sumstats.tsv* or a *batch_x.haplotypes.tsv* files
* Re-Integration with [strataG] (https://github.com/EricArcher/strataG.devel/tree/master/strataG.devel)
* Improved documentation and vignette
* Workflow tutorial
* More linkage map tools
* Use Shiny and ggvis when subplots or facets are available
* CRAN
* Interaction with [STACKS] (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) database (Web-interface)
* Reference genome tools
* Maybe try some integration with other GBS approaches: AftrRAD, pyRAD, dDocent
* ...suggestions ?


## Installation
You can try out the dev version of **stackr**. Follow the 2 steps below:

Step 1 You will need the package *devtools* and the dev version of *readr*
```r
install.packages("devtools") # to install
library(devtools) # to load
```

Step 2 Install **stackr**:
```r
install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr") # to install
library(stackr) # to load
```

Note:
Sometimes you'll get warnings while installing dependencies required for **stackr** or other R packages.
```r
Warning: cannot remove prior installation of package ‘stringi’
```

To solve this problem, delete the package manually and reinstall. On MAC computers:
```r
#In the Finder use the shortcut **cmd+shift+g** or in the menu bar : GO -> Go to Folder, copy/paste the text below:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library
```
Delete the problematic package.

If you know your way around the terminal and understand the consequences of using **sudo rm -R** command, here something faster to remove problematic packages:
```r
sudo rm -R /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/package_name
```

Changing **package_name** to the problematic package.
Reinstall the package.


On Mac OSX using a version of clang (the native compiler) with OpenMP greatly reduce the computation time for the imputation. There is a GCC version with OpenMP but it's highly unstable in R. To update your computer's compiler, follow the instruction below (inspired from [here](https://clang-omp.github.io)). In the terminal:

```r
cd Downloads
git clone https://github.com/clang-omp/llvm
git clone https://github.com/clang-omp/compiler-rt llvm/projects/compiler-rt
git clone -b clang-omp https://github.com/clang-omp/clang llvm/tools/clang

cd llvm
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

You need to tell R which compilers to use. Use TextWrangler or follow the lines below:
```r
cd ~
nano .R/Makevars
```

Enter the text below:
```r
CC=clang
CXX=clang++
PKG_CFLAGS=-g -O2
PKG_CXXFLAGS=-g -O2 -stdlib=libc++
```
Save and Exit with: crt-o, enter, crt-x


Preferably, re-install all packages depending on OpenMP or Rcpp:

```r
install.packages("Rcpp", type = "source")
install.packages("dplyr", type = "source")
install.packages("randomForestSRC", type = "source")
```


## GBS workflow
The **stackr** package fits currently at the end of the GBS workflow. Below, a flow chart using [STACKS] (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) and other software. You can use the [STACKS] (http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/) workflow [used in the Bernatchez lab] (https://github.com/enormandeau/stacks_workflow). ![](vignettes/GBS_workflow.png)
## stackr workflow 
Look at step 1 as a quality insurance step. We need to modify the data to play with it efficiently in R. To have reliable summary statistics, you first need good coverage of your alleles to call your genotypes, good genotype likelihood, enough individuals in each sampling sites and enough putative populations with your markers... Step 2 is where the actual work is done to remove artifactual and uninformative markers based on summary statistics of your markers.
![](vignettes/stackr_workflow.png)

## Example 

**Using *haplo2genind* function to do a DAPC analysis of your data (5 steps).**

Step 1. Load the necessary librairies, here is an example of how to do this:
```r
library(adegenet)
library(stackr)
```
Step 2. Set your working directory (e.g. the path to your **stacks** output files and 
where you want the output to be saved):

```r
setwd("/Users/thierry/Dropbox/brook_charr_pop/01_stacks_populations")
```
Step 3. Missing genotypes: 


First remove individuals with more than 30% missing genotypes 
from the *batch_1.haplotypes.tsv* file. Explore this parameter with different values. 


You can also provide the function with a whitelist of loci to keep (after filtering).
We are interested in the the blacklisted id output ("blacklisted.id.30.txt"),
but the function also outputs many things, see the function documentation.
```r
blacklisted.id <- missing_genotypes(haplotypes.file = "batch_1.haplotypes.tsv", 
whitelist.loci = "new.whitelist.txt", pop.id.start = 5, pop.id.end = 7, 
missing.geno.threshold = 30)
```

Step 4. Use the *haplo2genind* function to convert the haplotype file created by 
**stacks** into a genind object ready to use in **adegenet**. 

I use the whitelist of loci created after filtering the data and filter out the individuals with more than 30% of missing genotypes (with the blacklisted individuals, created above). 

I also ask for imputation of the data using Random Forest.

```r
genind.sturgeon <- haplo2genind(haplotypes.file = "batch_1.haplotypes.tsv", whitelist.loci = "my.whitelist.txt", blacklist.id = "blacklisted.id.30.txt", pop.levels = c("LSL", "DRM", "JEN", "LAN", "GRA", "BUR", "GUL", "LLI", "ANG", "WEI", "FOX", "HAY", "GOD", "CHU"), pop.id.start = 5, pop.id.end = 7, imputations = "rf", imputations.group = "populations", num.tree = 100, split.number = 100, iteration.rf = 10, verbose = FALSE)
```

You can see that the object created is not yet a genind object because it contains 2 things: the imputed data and the data without imputation. To access both genind dataset:
```r
names(genind.sturgeon)
genind.sturgeon.noimputation <- genind.sturgeon$no.imputation
genind.sturgeon.imputed <- genind.sturgeon$imputed
```

Step 5. These 2 genind objects can be use directly in **adegenet**:
```r
dapc.optim.a.score <- optim.a.score(dapc(genind.sturgeon.imputed, n.da = 100, n.pca = 50))
dapc.optim.a.score$best
```
